- sudo useradd -m -d /opt/tomcat -U -s /bin/false tomcat
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install default-jdk
- java -version
- cd /tmp
- wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.0.20/bin/apache-tomcat-10.0.20.tar.gz
- so our tomcat would be installed at /temp location, cd into that location /tomcat/bin/, you will see startup.sh
- start the server using basg startup.sh
- make sure to allow 8080 as part of the inbound rule in azure(vm-networking-inbound-port-rules),
- gitclone your app and cd into it,
- build it using mvn clean package (it will create target folder, inside it the folder containing the index.jsp file)
- move application-dir/target/"dir containing index file" /apache-tomcat-dir/webapp/
