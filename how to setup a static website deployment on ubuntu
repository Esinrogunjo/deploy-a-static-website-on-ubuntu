- create ubuntu vm with public IP, and allow ssh login either with new public key or exisitng public key
- Grab your public ip, and use it to create your A and CNAME(alias) record (wait till after propagation: continue with other setup)
- ssh into the ubuntu machine, update and upgrade it
- install nginx
- download your static app files (to be deployed)
- create dir/folder with your app uri as name e.g agas.photogallery.com, put your app files inside , and move to them to your www directorty (/var/www/).
- get your nginx configuration file ready : see sample below

server {
listen 80;
server_name your_domain.com;

    root /path/to/your/website;

    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

}

- after editing your confi file(s), copy them to /etc/nginx/sites-available : e.g(sudo cp agas.photogallery.com /etc/nginx/sites-availanle): use sudo to copy them because they need root permission, and if you used move , you will need to change file ownership(chown) to root for your config file(s).

- create soft link of each config file to /etc/nginx/site-enabled/ (sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/ agas.photogallery.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled)
- check your url on the browser , your app should be up now (but not secured)
- now we are going to install certbot for ssl (sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y )
- after installation, generate/request an ssl for your app based on your server(nginx) configuration: sudo certbot --nginx
- follow the prompt and generte your cert(s)
- Goodluck
